## Processing Multi-omic datasets
For whole genome sequencing, the analysis scripts are posted here for transparency but due to privacy concerns we will not release the data for the patients in this study.

For the rest of the data, including lipidomic (LCMS), proteomic (LCMS), transcriptomic (RNA-seq), and DNA methylation (EPIC Array), please follow guidance inside of the directory "Python".
